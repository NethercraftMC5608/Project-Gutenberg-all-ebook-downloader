# Project-Gutenberg-all-ebook-downloader
Downloads all 60000+ ebooks from Project Gutenberg's Database.
***Right now, this tool only downloads epub files***

NOTE: everyone knows that a shitty programmer, has shitty code. and i am that programmer.

Easy to change, some things implemented dont work, but im lazy so i leave it in, so yeah, 
It works so why not? might not be that optimized but you know, just work with it.

i dont want to say alpha, because most people can get this done in like 2 minutes with a average typing speed of 60wpm, but fine, 
first version
drag the py file into the directory you need to put the ebooks in, like a calibre library server.


~~WARNING FOR LINUX USERS, USE THE CONVERT EPUB TOOL AT YOUR OWN RISK, IT CHANGES ALL OF THE FILES (AND FOLDERS) EXTENSIONS IN THE CURRENT DIRECTORY TO EPUB AS IT DOES NOT DO IT ALREADY, PLEASE CREATE ANOTHER DIRECTORY.~~ Nevermind, fixed it in latest commit. they now download with .epub file extension names.

__USAGE:__
To download all ebooks from Project-Gutenberg database. just run the script like you normally do.
`python3 PGAED.py`
To download a specific ebook by ID. use the code below, and it will download it.
`python 3 PGAED.py IDGOESHERE`

*If i am encouraged i might add some more features but now, this needs to be optimized, but i am sleepy so, goodnight.
