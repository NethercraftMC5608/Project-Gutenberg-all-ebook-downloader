~~WARNING FOR LINUX USERS, USE THE CONVERT EPUB TOOL AT YOUR OWN RISK, IT CHANGES ALL OF THE FILES (AND FOLDERS) EXTENSIONS IN THE CURRENT DIRECTORY TO EPUB AS IT DOES NOT DO IT ALREADY, PLEASE CREATE ANOTHER DIRECTORY.~~ Nevermind, fixed it in latest commit. they now download with .epub file extension names.
